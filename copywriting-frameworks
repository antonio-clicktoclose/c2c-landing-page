# Copywriting Frameworks Reference

## Alex Hormozi — Ad Copy Framework

### MAGIC Headline Formula ($100M Offers)
- **M**agnet: Grab attention (reason why, pattern interrupt)
- **A**vatar: Call out exactly who this is for (persona call-out)
- **G**oal: The specific desired outcome
- **I**nterval: Timeframe to achieve it
- **C**ontainer: The vehicle/mechanism to get there

### "More Good / Less Bad" Primary Text Framework
Ask 4 questions before writing:
1. MORE GOOD: What positive outcomes do they gain by taking action?
2. LESS BAD: What negative consequences do they avoid by acting?
3. MORE BAD: What negative consequences occur if they DON'T act?
4. LESS GOOD: What opportunities do they miss if they don't act?

### Persona Call-Out Strategy (2024/2025)
- Open every ad with a specific persona call-out
- Example: "If you own a business doing $250k+ in profit..."
- The algorithm uses the call-out to find the right people
- Create multiple variations with different call-outs
- Be specific enough to qualify, broad enough to scale

### Hormozi Value Equation
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)
- Increase dream outcome
- Increase perceived likelihood of achieving it
- Decrease perceived time to result
- Decrease perceived effort/sacrifice required

## Matt Gray — Content to Revenue Framework

### Hook → Story → Offer → CTA Structure
1. **HOOK**: First 1-2 lines. Must stop the scroll.
   - Appeal to self-interest
   - Use specific, substantial numbers
   - Sell the outcome, not the process
   - "ROI Framework": Research, Output, Iteration

2. **STORY**: Build connection and perceived value.
   - Relatable situation or data point
   - "Seeds of curiosity" to keep reading
   - Each sentence earns the next sentence

3. **OFFER**: Stack value, create urgency.
   - Position as a gift or special opportunity
   - Stack bonuses
   - Compete on generosity

4. **CTA**: Convert attention to action.
   - Clear, single next step
   - Low friction (quiz, diagnostic, free audit)
   - Guide from awareness → consideration → transaction

### Content Principles
- Every sentence must be "scannable" and "snappy"
- Each sentence serves ONE clear purpose
- Use "seeds of curiosity" throughout
- Double-space for readability on mobile
